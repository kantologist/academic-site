Household energy consumption, especially cooking energy, accounts for a larger part of the overall energy consumption in developing countries such as Nigeria and other African countries. This design became necessary due to the irregular supply of electricity and high cost of gas and kerosene, all of which constitute the main source of energy for electric cookers, gas cookers, and kerosene stoves.[Published by National Instruments](http://sine.ni.com/cs/app/doc/p/id/cs-16795?nisrc=RSS-solar-en#)
