Conference attendees are frequently overwhelmed by the scale of the
event they participate in. Young participants, most especially find it difficult
to identify the right co-attendees to reach out and connect with. We believe
that by creating a simple and intuitive app that removes the anxiety and
uncertainty from arrangement of such meetings we will dramatically
increase the quantity and quality of connections. Following each
match-making we collect user feedback and retrain our model to improve
the quality of recommendations before the next round. The goal is for users
to report that through the usage of this app they were able to make more
meaningful connections during the conference than they would otherwise
be able to. We used a differential privacy approach in order to protect
usersâ€™ data in training the model as opposed to a regular machine learning
approach.
